# `generateTimestampedId`

## Description
The `generateTimestampedId` function is a hybrid identifier generator that combines cryptographic randomness with a high-resolution timestamp. This ensures uniqueness and sortability, making it ideal for AI-driven workflows where event ordering, job tracking, and versioning are critical. Unlike traditional random IDs, this function allows AI systems to retrieve the latest events, jobs, or models efficiently by leveraging time-based sorting.

`generateNanoId` creates a purely random, cryptographically secure ID, while `generateTimestampedId` combines a timestamp with randomness for sortable, time-ordered uniqueness in AI workflows.

## AI Use Cases
* AI Model Versioning – Assigns time-ordered unique IDs to AI models, ensuring proper version tracking.
* AI Event Logging & Auditing – Helps maintain chronological AI logs for debugging and compliance.
* AI Pipeline Execution IDs – Ensures sequential tracking of data preprocessing, model training, and deployment steps.

## Conclusion
The `generateTimestampedId` function is a highly valuable tool for AI applications requiring ordered event tracking and unique AI workload identification. By merging cryptographic randomness with timestamps, it enables reliable sorting, prevents collisions, and enhances AI observability. Whether used for AI task scheduling, version control, or distributed processing, this function ensures scalability and robustness in enterprise AI applications.
