# `sleep`

## Description
The `sleep()` function is a utility that introduces controlled delays in execution. While simple, it plays a crucial role in AI applications where timing and rate control are essential.

## AI Use Cases
* API Rate Limiting: Prevents exceeding request limits by introducing exponential backoff delays.

* AI Model Warm-up: Simulates loading time to reduce cold starts for ML models.

* Chatbot Typing Delay: Mimics human-like responses in AI-driven chat systems.

* Automated Trading Bots: Ensures controlled execution between AI-driven trades.

* AI Data Processing: Helps batch processing of large datasets to prevent system overload.

## Conclusion
The sleep() function is a fundamental tool in AI-based applications, optimizing execution timing and enhancing system stability.
