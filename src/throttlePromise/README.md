# `throttlePromise`

## Description
The `throttlePromise` function ensures an async function executes at most once within a specified time interval. If the function is called multiple times within that period, it returns the same ongoing promise instead of creating a new one. This is crucial for AI-powered applications that require rate-limiting, API optimization, and controlled execution frequency.

## AI Use Cases
* AI Chatbots & Virtual Assistants – Ensures AI-powered chat responses are rate-controlled while maintaining responsiveness.
* AI-Driven Real-Time Data Processing – Limits sensor data analysis frequency for AI-driven IoT applications.
* AI in Financial Market Analysis - Prevents stock market AI bots from overloading trading APIs with excessive requests.

## Conclusion
The `throttlePromise` function is a critical tool for optimizing AI-powered applications by ensuring controlled execution of async tasks. It improves performance, reduces unnecessary API requests, and prevents overloading AI-driven systems
