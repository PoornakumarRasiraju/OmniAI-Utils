# `debouncePromise`

## Description
The `debouncePromise` function delays the execution of an async function until a specified time has passed since the last invocation. It ensures that only the latest call is executed, preventing redundant API requests, expensive computations, or frequent AI model invocations.

## AI Use Cases
* AI-Powered Search Autocomplete – Prevents multiple API requests while a user types in a search bar.
* AI Chatbots & Virtual Assistants – Delays sending user messages until the user stops typing.
* AI-Based Image Processing - Waits until the user stops adjusting image filters before sending it to the AI model.
* AI-Powered Speech Recognition – Waits until the speaker finishes a phrase before sending it to speech-to-text AI models.

## Conclusion
The `debouncePromise` function optimizes AI-driven workflows, ensuring that API calls and computations only execute when necessary. It enhances efficiency in real-time AI applications, preventing wasted resources and redundant operations.
